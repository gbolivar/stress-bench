# Commands

## Clone repository
```shell
git clone git@github.com:gbolivar/stress-bench.git
```

## Access the project
```shell
cd stress-bench
```

### Commands executed locally

Once the repository is cloned, the first thing is to generate the docker images:

```shell
docker-compose up -d --build
```
### To run the command in the container:

Scan an image in python with alpine
```shell
# Ontro project
docker-compose exec apache-bench ab -n 100 -c 10 -k -S https://ironsofts.com/
```
```shell
# Any part
docker exec -it apache-bench ab -n 1000 -c 10 -k -S https://httpd.apache.org/
```

Then go into the backend container:

```shell
docker exec -it apache-bench /bin/bash
```

To exit the container, use the exit command:

```shell
exit
```

Then you may want to delete the entire project container and leave it clean.:

```shell
docker-compose down
```
